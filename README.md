# Z

**z** is a fish port of [z](http://github.com/rupa/z).

**z** tracks the directories you visit. With a combination of
frequency and recency, it enables you to jump to the directory in
mind.

A _pure-fish_ port means it is _fast_ and _fish-friendly_, with
tab-completions and lazy-loading. Top that off with greater
customizability and a small amount of added functionality.

## Install
> Note: fish version >2.2.0 is required.

### fish >=2.7.0
With [fisherman]

```
fisher jethrokuan/z
```

### fish <2.7.0
Install the legacy z plugin:

```
fisher z@pre27
```

For usage information, [read me](https://github.com/jethrokuan/z/blob/master/man/man1/z.md).
